	* Added `varnames` and `varnames<-` S3 methods for "GPtail".

2016-03-09  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Completed many changes in the SeaLevGuide. The .Rnw file must
	now be compiled with knitr and no longer with Sweave.

	* Fixed bug in 'convSL' (new version). When computing the finite
	differences on 'par.y', elements names are lost in 'par.plus[ ,
	ip]' when 'p.y' is 1. The function 'myFuns$F.y' could then no
	longer work as it should. Solved with an uggly 'if (p.y > 1L)'.

	* Fixed bug in 'convSL2': 'threshold.y' was not used for
	quadrature points to shift the result.

	* Fixed bug in 'GPtail': 'threshold.y' was not used as it should.

	* Renamed convSL to 'convSLOld' then 'convSL2' to 'convSL'

	* Fixed a bug in 'convSL2'. When the distribution had only one
	parameter, the matrix of gradients of S was turned into a vector
	due to a missing 'drop = FALSE'.

	* Changed the default vale of 'N.quad' in 'convSL2', because the
	default was too small which caused bumpy curves on Return level
	plots.

	* Added the GPtail (S3) class and some method. The GPtail creator
	function computes the convolution of a spline density and a GPD
	with provided parameters. The computation uses an enterly new
	formula.

	* Added the SplineDensity (S3) class and some methods.

	* Added the new function convSL2, a new implementation of convSL
	which should replace it.

	
2013-07-08  yves  <deville.yves@alpestat.com>

	* Added a NAMESPACE.
	
	* Vignette 'SeaLevGuide' was slightly modified. The 'fRenouv'
	function was replaced in code chunks by 'Renouv' and
	the covariance of a "Renouv" object is now found using the 'vcov'
	method. The test function \phi(x, y) received its missing 'y'
	argument. Some errors concerning english were corrected, e.g.
	'conditional to' -> 'conditional on'.

	* The .Rbuildignore file was edited in order to ship with the
	package only the pdf file, the .Rnw code and R code.

	* RSLplot now has args 'below' and 'alpha.below'. The
	semi-transparent rectangle is no longer drawn in 'convSL' but in
	'RSLplot'. This rectangle can partially occult return
	level/confidence lines yet letting empirical points unaffected.

	* Typos found by Lise Bardet in the Rd files / manual were
	corrected. Howevet the formal 'pct.conf' of convSL was not renamed
	to math the names of Renext, since Renext formals names might be
	changed in the future.
	
	* Vignette was slightly modified. The names of Pugh and Vassie is
	cited at the begining. The example with empirical points was
	slightly modified.

	* RSLplot now supports the plotting of experimental points
	given through 'z' and 'duration' formals.

	* convSL has an 'alpha.below' formal allowing the user to "gray"
	or partially occult the region below HAT+threshold on the return
	level plot.

	* Rd files were corrected. Note that the use of references in
	french lead to using the \enc{}{} macro and the \encoding{UTF-8}
	section. The manual is generated using Rd2dvi with with an
	'--encoding=utf8' option, but it seems to works fine without it.
	
	* Vignette was corrected. The plotting of experimental points
	is described (how return periods are computed) and illustrated
	with examples.

	* convSL allows the superposition of an asymptotic return
	level curve for exponential and GPD POT distributions,
	only for postitive shape in the GPD case.
	The exponential case provides a validation for the convolution
	comptation, since the asymptotic curve is exact for return levels
	> threshold.y + xmax (see Vignette) and is computed independently
	from the convolution.

	* convSL arguments names percents for confidence bands are now
	given in 'pct.conf'. The threshold. in 'threshold.y' an now be set
	to 'NA' in which case the distribution of Y is for the surge
	itself rather than the surge exceedance Y-u. This allows the use
	of GEV distribution as in B. Simon's Book. Graphical parameters
	are passed to 'RSLplot' (e.g. 'Tlim' and 'problim') or to plot
	('main', 'ylim').
	
	* RSLplot Arguments of the 'RSLplot' function are changed.  The
	args concerning confidence bands are named ***.conf.  Two new ars
	'Tlim' and 'problim' allow the user to set the x axis limits in
	periods (years) or probability.  The default values have been
	changed to cover larger ranges. It is possible to use filled
	confidence regions, to set the color and line type of these.
