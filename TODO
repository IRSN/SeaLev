                      TO DO LIST (ideas)

             *************************************

 o [X] Add a NAMESPACE file.	     

 o Add a S3 simulation method for the classes "SplineDensity" and
   "GPtail". This could rely simply on an approximation of the
   distribution function as a broken line, and on a 'simulate' method
   written for lists (intended to have 'x' and 'y' elements) see next
   point. For instance, simulate(object = Brest.tide, nsim = 100) draws
   100 astronomical tides for Brest.

 o Define a (S3 or S4) class for distributions with bounded support
   and density given as a continuous broken line, as is the density of
   High Tide Astronomical levels.  Methods would be: 'plot' (with
   filled region undex the curve), 'range' 'max', 'min'... Also
   'simulate' could be used to draw samples from tide that could be
   combined with surges (either empirical or simulated).

 o Implement Bayesian inference with MCMC results on input. 
   For large return periods, the quadratures can be costly 
   to compute, so a restriction to the spline tidal density 
   could be preferred, with C code for speed requirements.   

 o Allow the use of mixed distribution for surges with a 
   semi-parametric density estimation below a threshold u and
   say, a GPD tail above. Such distributions were 
   described by Dixon and Tawn. They would allow a predictions
   for low or moderate return periods (1 to 100 years) as 
   well as extremes (100 to 1000 or more years).
   This distributions could be registrated as a class with
   specific methods 'thresold', etc.
 
 o Allow the use of a list to group several formals of the 
   same family for graphic purposes. E.g. lty.conf, col.conf, 
   etc. could be replaced by a list with elements lty, col, etc.
